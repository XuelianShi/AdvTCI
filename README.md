## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper: **"Adversarial Triangular Chromatic Illumination: A Stealthy Physical Attack on Object Detectors"**.

**AdvTCI** is a novel black-box physical attack method that utilizes **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** to generate adversarial perturbations by optimizing a parameterized colored triangular illumination. Unlike traditional patch-based attacks, AdvTCI is **non-contact**, **stealthy**, and capable of achieving high attack success rates against advanced object detectors (e.g., YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN) in both digital and physical environments.



## 🛠️ Requirements

The code is tested with Python 3.8+ and PyTorch 1.7+. To install the required dependencies:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Dataset

This dataset named TT100K-TCI contains 10427 images. We then divided TT100K-TCI into training, validation,
and testing sets with 7,568, 1,889, and 970 images, respectively.
